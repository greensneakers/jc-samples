## Interactive State Charts

July, 2018

I collaborated on these interactive graphics, created as part of the [50-State Report on Public Safety](https://50statespublicsafety.us/) project.

The graphics were created using [Highcharts JS](https://www.highcharts.com/) and the data is parsed from csv files. Users can select a state to generate interactive charts and related text.

The scripts in this repo are prototype versions of the live charts seen here:
