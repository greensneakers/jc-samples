## State Workbooks Map

July, 2018

This interactive map was created as part of the [50-State Report on Public Safety](https://50statespublicsafety.us/) project.

The map was created using [Highcharts JS](https://www.highcharts.com/). It allows a user to access a state workbook for each of the 50 states by clicking a state tile on the map.

Demo version of the map can be found here: <https://karenelizabethball.com/projects/50-state-map/>

Live version of the map can be found here: <https://50statespublicsafety.us/workbooks/>
